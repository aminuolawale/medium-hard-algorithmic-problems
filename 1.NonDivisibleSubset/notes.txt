Question: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/non-divisible-subset/problem

Overview of Solution:
If two numbers a and b would add up to be divisible by k, then a%k = i and b%k = k-i where
i is some positive integer. Therefore for each remainder i we must choose numbers from the 
set S such that we have no pair a,b such that a%k = i and b%k = k-i.
We count the number of elements within S for each remainder into a frequency array f[i].
We then loop through f[i] and accumulate the maximum of f[i] and f[k-i]. This should give
us the size of the maximal nondivisible array.

But:
1. for i=0, we want to make sure we select at most 1 element because two will render the resulting
set invalid.

2. if k is an even number then any number with remainder i = k//2 must occur only once or else
the set would be invalid.
